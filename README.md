# Effectiveness of the EU Emissions Trading System 

This project focuses on the question whether or not the European Union Emissions Trading Systems impacts CO2e emissions in the EU 
and if so, what impact it has on the global state of emissions.

To answer the question data from the German federal environment agency and the EU (in specific the EDGAR database) was used.
The full report on the analysis can be found [here](./project/analysis-report.pdf).

It could be shown that the EU ETS does indeed impact the emission of CO2e in the EU, further decreasing the emitted CO2e.
Nevertheless, global emission values are still increasing as many states either don't regulate the emission of CO2e or 
regulations are not as effective.
