\section{Data Report}\label{data-report}}

This data report contains information on the data sources used for this
project, the data pipeline for cleaning and extracting them and
limitations of the chosen data.

The main question for this project to answer is:

\textbf{How significant is the impact of the EU Emissions Trading System
(EU ETS) in the sectors it sanctions and to what degree does that make
an impact on global emissions.}

    \hypertarget{data-sources}{%
\subsection{Data Sources}\label{data-sources}}

The data sources chosen to answer the main question of this project
with, are data of the EU Emissions Trading System in form of the
\textbf{EU Transaction Log} (EUTL) to find the exact CO2e emissions per
sector, the \textbf{development of the CO2e price in the EU} to link
that to rising/falling CO2e emissions and finally a dataset that
contains \textbf{global GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions data} to compare the EU with
what's happening on a global scale.

Following table contains a quick overview on the data sources, their
origin, license, structure and quality. The quality column references
the quality dimensions abbreviated in the order ``Accuracy'',
``Completeness'', ``Consistency'', ``Timeliness'' and ``Relevancy''. A
"\_" means that the quality dimension is not met.

The two datasets concerning the EUTL are both licensed under the CC BY
4.0 DEED license, which means the data can be adapted and shared as long
as appropriate credit and a link to the license is given. The dataset
from the Umweltbundesamt is published under § 12a EGovG, which allows
any citizen to freely access and process the data. Additionally when
using the data, the Umweltbundesamt has to be mentioned. The global GHG
emissions dataset is licensed under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license, which
allows to format and redistribute the data as long as the creator is
mentioned.

    \hypertarget{data-pipeline}{%
\subsection{Data Pipeline}\label{data-pipeline}}

The data pipeline for cleaning the datasets is written in Python using
the pandas library. It follows the same pattern for all different data
sources that are (1) downloaded from their HTTP resource, (2) cleaned
and (3) stored into a SQLite database.

\hypertarget{cleaning-and-transformation}{%
\subsubsection{Cleaning and
Transformation}\label{cleaning-and-transformation}}

As all the datasets were already in a structured state only minor
cleaning and transformation steps had to be done. Concerning the EUTL
the \textbf{two sheets of its .xlsx file were joined} into one to
improve readability, because the activity types (i.e.~sectors) of the
companies were stored separate to the main log and were only referenced
via an id.

Also the emissions data of the EUTL was split into VERIFIED\_EMISSIONS
and CH\_VERIFIED\_EMISSIONS for emissions that stem from the inclusion
of Switzerland in the EU ETS. To have a single emission value to work
on, these \textbf{two columns had to be added up}. Because some of the
values in the emission columns were not integers, but resembled another
information in string format those were \textbf{extracted to a new
column}.

In the original EUTL dataset, each year was represented by multiple
columns that featured e.g.~the allocated and verified emissions. To be
able to work with the data, I created columns that contained said data
for all years by \textbf{concatenating each of the previous columns} and
\textbf{adding a year column} (see table below). I also \textbf{removed
columns} that I didn't count as important for answering my question.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lllllllll@{}}
\toprule
Before: & Country & \ldots{} & Em\_2023 & Alloc\_2023 & CH\_Em\_2023 &
\ldots{} & Em\_2008 & Alloc\_2008\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
After: & Country & \ldots{} & Emissions & Allocation & \ldots{} &
\ldots{} & \ldots{} & Year\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\caption{EUTL Structure Before and After Cleaning}
\end{longtable}

Both the EUTL and the dataset on CO2e prices had a \textbf{header that
had to be removed}. For the CO2e price dataset, \textbf{column names had
to be manually added} to the dataframe.

\hypertarget{dealing-with-errors}{%
\subsubsection{Dealing With Errors}\label{dealing-with-errors}}

The data pipeline does not explicitly account for any changing input
data. Nevertheless as all datasets are structured and resemble some kind
of log, the pipeline should still be able to process updated versions of
these datasets as long as their fundamental structure doesn't change. As
for errors, none were apparent in the datasets up until now. Errors that
might occur during the execution of the pipeline (i.e.~network or OS
related) are negligible as they are dependent on the system its running
on.

    \hypertarget{results-and-limitations}{%
\subsection{Results and Limitations}\label{results-and-limitations}}

The output of the data pipeline is a SQLite database, which contains
multiple tables, namely ``eu\_transaction\_log'',
``eu\_ets\_operators'', ``co2e\_price\_development'',
``global\_ghg\_emissions''. All the tables contain structured data that
aligns with the data quality dimensions mentioned in the lecture.

SQLite was chosen to store the cleaned data, as the data was and still
is structured with fixed data types and it also allows for loading the
data into a database viewer if needed.

\textbf{Thoughts on Correctness:} The datasets were mostly published by
either the EU or the german state. As the data origins are all
governmental and not motivated by e.g.~company marketing I reckon the
data to be accurate. The EUTL in specific is automatically generated by
logging all transactions made between accounts in the EU ETS and ensures
that these transactions comply with the EU ETS rules. EDGAR on the other
hand, which publishes the dataset on global GHG emissions, also claims
to provide independent emission estimates through data collected from EU
member states or UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) parties.

\textbf{Thougths on Completeness:} The same governmental argument from
before also goes for the completeness of the datasets. The datasets also
didn't seem to be missing any crucial information.

\textbf{Thougths on Representativeness:} All datasets grew over the span
of decades as they mostly represent the history of CO2e emissions and
their pricing over the years up to 2023, which I count as up-to-date. I
also reckon no important data was lost or distorted during the cleaning
process as no new data was added and any data that was removed was
double checked.

Concluding the data report I have a good feeling for the data analysis
and final report. So far the data seems viable and not missing any
critical information.
